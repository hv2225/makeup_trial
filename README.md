## Makeup Trial

This project is a showcase of interactive HTML/CSS. Users can change the makeup colors on some face features, such as eyebrows, eyelids, and lips.

Through this project, I learned to (1) use *objects* to represent groupings of data, (2) use *arrays* and *objects*, (3) maximize *interactive* elements through *events*, (4) utilize *event listeners* through click buttons, etc.
